- [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl): MIRACL 🌍🙌🌏 (Multilingual Information Retrieval Across a Continuum of Languages) is an WSDM 2023 Cup challenge that focuses on search across 18 different languages, which collectively encompass over three billion native speakers around the world.
- [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini): Anserini is a toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research.
By building on Lucene, we aim to bridge the gap between academic information retrieval research and the practice of building real-world search applications. Among other goals, our effort aims to be [the opposite of this](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1689).[*](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/reproducibility.md) Anserini grew out of [a reproducibility study of various open-source retrieval engines in 2016](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Lin_etal_ECIR2016.pdf) (Lin et al., ECIR 2016).
